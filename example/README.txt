# This is a demo for KinLab, a chemical kinetic simulation webapp powered by Kynetix

* Run an example job in `/example_job`
    1. go to `/example_job`
    2. click `Create or open a job` button to open an existing model setting panel
    3. do something on the panel or leave it unchanged
    4. click the `Run` button to run the model
    5. after the job finished, click the `Generate report` to check the result report

* Create your own job
    1. go to `empty_job`
    2. do something to create your own micro kinetic model
    3. run the model in the same way mentioned above

Good Luck!
